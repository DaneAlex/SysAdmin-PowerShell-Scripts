# SysAdmin-PowerShell-Scripts
Scripts I've used in my time as a SysAdmin, or written about as part of the blog at onsb.co. 

# Usage
These scripts are meant to be shared as a learning point for PowerShell. As such, I am using the basic MIT License for this repository. Feel free to use and share this code however you like, but please do your own research for your own use case. If the scripts help you, please feel free to follow me here or on my blog onsb.co. Maybe even talk nicely about me when the opportunity arises.  

Most of these scripts I've written comments for, or maybe written about them on the blog. Whenever possible, I've tried to be sure to give credit to original authors if any portion of my code was learned or borrowed from another source. If I am unable to find the original author, I may just list the site or forum I found them on.
